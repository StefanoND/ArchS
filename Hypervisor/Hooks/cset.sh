# This hook uses the `cset` tool to dynamically isolate and unisolate CPUs using
# the kernel's cgroup cpusets feature. While it's not as effective as
# full kernel-level scheduler and timekeeping isolation, it still does wonders
# for VM latency as compared to not isolating CPUs at all. Note that vCPU thread
# affinity is a must for this to work properly.

# Since I want to assign my Host and VM each to a different CCX: I'll leave the first CCX to my Host and the second to my VM
# Fo a visual representation you can install "hwloc" and run "lstopo" for a visual representation of what I just said
# Since the 1st CCX have the cores 0-3 and threads 8-11 and the 2nd CCX have the cores 4-7 and threads are 12-15
# I'll fill HOST_CORES and VIRT_CORES accordingly
#
# For the masks: use this calulator: https://bitsum.com/tools/cpu-affinity-calculator/
# Copy the last numbers/letters into the masks for example
#
# I have 16 threads so I select all CPUs from 0 to 15
# The output was 0x000000000000FFFF, so I put the last characters in my TOTAL_CORES_MASK (In this case FFFF)
#
# For the HOST_CORES_MASK I select the CPUs 0 to 3 and 8 to 11
# The output was 0x0000000000000F0F, so I put the last characters in my HOST_CORES_MASK (In this case F0F)
