# CPU Pinning

### Add CPUTune section in XML right below "vcpu placement="static"...."
### This will ensure the VM will only use those cores instead of searching and using available cores (which reduces performance)
### The amount of cores depends on what you'll be using the VM for
### If you have a secondary GPU and will only game on the VM, usually 50% of threads is enough
### If just for browsing the internet, 4-8 threads is enough
### Since I'm going to Daily Drive this VM and only have 1 GPU I'll do a single GPU-Passthrough so I'll assign all threads to it
### Physical CPU siblings must be Virtual CPU siblings (Check "Note 2" at the bottom of this page)
### Assign at least threads 0 and 8 in "emulatorpin cpuset" which the host will use (Linux likes thread 0, and thread 8 is 0's sibling, in my case, check)
    <cputune>
      <vcpupin vcpu="0" cpuset="0"/>
      <vcpupin vcpu="1" cpuset="8"/>
      <vcpupin vcpu="2" cpuset="1"/>
      <vcpupin vcpu="3" cpuset="9"/>

      <vcpupin vcpu="12" cpuset="6"/>

      <vcpupin vcpu="14" cpuset="7"/>
      <vcpupin vcpu="15" cpuset="15"/>

## CPU Siblings/Cousins
### CPU Siblings are threads in of the same core, and CPU cousins are threads from different cores
### In the illustration below, thread 0 and thread 8 are siblings be cause they share the same core (Core 1)
### Thread 3 and 11 are siblings be cause they share the same core (Core 4) and so on
### Thread 0 and thread 1 are cousins be cause they're in different cores (Core 1 and 2 respectively)
### Thread 9 and thread 12 are cousins be cause they're in different cores (Core 2 and 5 respectively)

### Note: This is only a visual representation of a 8 Core/16 Thread CPU, it's not an exact match of a real layout
### CPUs with different cores will have different layouts, higher core-count CPUs will have more CCXs
### CPUs without hyperthreading (Simultaneous Multi-Threading SMT for AMD) will have 1 thread per core (instead of 2)

### Note 2: This is only true for physical CPUs, QEMU's virtual CPUs siblings are 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, etc
### So to make physical siblings be the same virtual siblings, you'll assign cores 0 and 8 to vcores 0 and 1 respectively,
### cores 1 and 9 to vcores 2 and 3 respectively, cores 2 and 10 to vcores 4 and 5 respectively and so on
