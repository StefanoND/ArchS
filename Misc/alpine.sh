#
# In "## User privilege specification"
# Under "root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL" add "USERNAME ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL" where USERNAME is the username you want to be sudo
USERNAME ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
#
# In "## Uncomment to allow members of group sudo to execute any command"
# Look for "#%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL" and uncomment it
%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
#
# In command mode type ":w" to save and ":q" to quit. You can type ":q!" to quit without saving
# Save and exit.

# Done
