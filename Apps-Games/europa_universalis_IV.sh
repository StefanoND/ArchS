# Install without changing anything.
#
# After installing run the game once, it'll open up the  Paradox Interacive launcher, launch it, log in, run the game, the game will crash,
# Close the launcher and edit the game's settings
#
# Change "Wine Version" to "Wine - lutris-X.X-X-x86_64" (Where the X are the version number)
# Click on "Other" and "Select an alternative EXE to run" and choose "eu4.exe"
# Optional: Check "Enable Esync", "Enable Fsync", "Enable FSR Hack" (I chose strength of 2), "Use GameMode" and "Enable Mangohud"
#
# For the FSR to work you must change the game's resolution to a resolution lower than your native resolution.
