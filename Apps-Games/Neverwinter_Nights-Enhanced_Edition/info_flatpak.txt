When using the flatpak version, it'll be stored in it's own .local/share, instead of the normal .local/share

"$HOME/.local/share" (Normal)
"$HOME/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share" (Flatpak)

If you're placing your NWN's Documents folder elsewhere, you must point to it in flatpak like so:
flatpak override --user --filesystem=/path/to/nwn/documents com.valvesoftware.Steam

then you edit your flatpak's nwn.ini file to point to the correct location

Note: DON'T FORGET TO COPY YOUR "cdkey.ini" TO THE DESIRED LOCATION
